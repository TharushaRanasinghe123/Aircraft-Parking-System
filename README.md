# Aircraft Parking System: Leveraging Data Structures and Algorithms for Efficient Management  

## Overview  
The Aircraft Parking System is a dynamic and efficient solution for managing airport parking logistics. Designed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms module, this project utilizes advanced data structures like doubly linked lists to optimize parking schedules, enable real-time tracking, and ensure seamless updates to parking data.  

## Features  
- **Dynamic Data Management**: Utilizes a doubly linked list for efficient organization and real-time updates.  
- **Comprehensive Information Display**: Shows detailed aircraft information, including airline name, registration number, and entry/departure times.  
- **Real-time Parking Status**: Provides instant visualization of parking availability, enhancing operational efficiency.  
- **Robust Input Validation**: Ensures accurate time and date inputs for data integrity.  
- **Flexible Modifications**: Allows easy updates or deletion of aircraft entries to accommodate changing schedules.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Data Structure**: Doubly Linked List
